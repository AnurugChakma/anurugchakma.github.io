      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
       I hold a PhD in Political Science from the School of Politics & International Relations (SPIR) at the Australian National University (ANU), an MSc in Governance and Development from the University of Antwerp, and Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Peace and Conflict Studies from the University of Dhaka. I am currently a Research Fellow in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University and a Visiting Fellow in the School of Regulation and Global Governance (RegNet) at ANU. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at ANU and a Lecturer and Assistant Professor in the Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Dhaka. My research examines terrorism, civil wars, peace processes, Indigenous rights, migration, diaspora humanitarianism, and the resilience and integrity of elections in the face of environmental, societal, and technological threats, employing qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods, including natural language processing and machine learning.
