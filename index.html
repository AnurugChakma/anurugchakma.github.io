      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
     I hold a PhD in Political Science from the School of Politics and International Relations (SPIR) at the Australian National University (ANU), an MSc in Governance and Development from the University of Antwerp, and Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Peace and Conflict Studies from the University of Dhaka. I am currently a Research Fellow in the School of Government and International Relations (SGIR) at Griffith University and a Visiting Fellow in the School of Regulation and Global Governance (RegNet) at ANU. I was previously a Research Fellow at ANU and a Lecturer and Assistant Professor in the Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Dhaka. My research uses qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, to study terrorism, civil wars, peace processes, Indigenous rights, diaspora humanitarianism, and the resilience of elections and democracy, among other topics.
